# Shopping Cart Project

This project represents a significant milestone in my journey as a developer, marking my first complex and feature-rich application. It showcases various techniques and technologies, demonstrating my growth and skills in web development.

## Key Features and Techniques

- **Data Fetching**: The project incorporates data fetching from an external API to populate the product catalog. This demonstrates my ability to integrate external data sources into web applications.

- **State Management**: Utilizing state management, I have successfully implemented features like adding products to the cart, updating quantities, and managing the cart's contents.

- **Global State Management**: I've used global state management to ensure that the shopping cart data is accessible and synchronized across different components. This illustrates my proficiency in managing complex application states.

- **LocalStorage Integration**: To enhance user experience, I've implemented the saving and loading of cart data to/from LocalStorage. This feature ensures that users can continue shopping seamlessly across sessions.

- **Inheritance**: The project utilizes inheritance principles to create reusable components, promoting code maintainability and scalability.

- **Routing**: Efficiently managing application routes allows users to navigate between different sections of the shopping experience, such as the product catalog, cart, and product details.

- **Reusable Functions and Components**: I've designed the project with a focus on code reusability, creating functions and components that can be easily repurposed.

- **Styles**: The project's visual design is a reflection of my personal style preferences. All styles are crafted using vanilla CSS, showcasing my ability to create appealing and user-friendly interfaces.

- **React Hooks**: The project leverages React hooks extensively, including `useState`, `useEffect`, `useParams`, and `useContext`, to manage component state and side effects.
